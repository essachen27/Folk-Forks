Hi, I am new to GitHub, spare mercy on me, daunting place as I don't really know much about coding. 
.
Here I am, share my explorations of playing with tree forks in my master of architecture in cuhk, a uni in Hong Kong.
Better late than never, please kindly read my story. And I hope you find it a little bit useful and may comment on it .

Story Chapter 01 
.
So my studio is "Net zero..." so basically we need to try balancing the number of footprints to make it more environmentally friendly. 
The beginning story, when I get into research expending from the "tree god" tales of my site, my tutor Yutaka Yano and Sarah introduced me 
this project from "Architectural Association, Hooke Park Campus; Hooke Park Educational Trust". 
A prestigious school that creates and explore architecture things out of the woods. 

With a fruitful journey through looking how they made it through their design progress, here I wanted to try "make" one myself.  
. 
They 3D scanned the huge woods they found on the site, and make it back to real world in place using robotics arms. 
It is then utilized the digital world to form structural calculations on the woods and create a roof skeleton design in the woods. 
. 
So based on this projects, with a limited resources, actually there should have better ways to do it such as recap or mobile app scanning the place.
Instead I did everything in a safe plan. Picked a few branches from the ground from the site, and bring it back, started learning 3D scanned in the computer lab from my uni.
.
spent days HANDCRAFTED the random tree branches I picked on the floor into a beautiful tree hut. Strangely beautiful things. And strange me...I have no clue where it will take me to
You may check out the progress of how I made it. It is fun but people might find it is boring â€¦ maybe I am self hypering.

It is then Yutaka's wise word that highlight the difficult part of it all. "If you can crafted it by hand, you can turn it digitally into 3D model." then here comes a whole new era of my thesis...

I started 3D Scan it on the table and created my own optimizing options script using the new idea of galapagos... it helps you generates the best options according to the rule/constrictions you gave...
.
you may download the 3D scanned file here to see how detail actually a branches can be scanned, tho the file size is realatively huge even for a small branches.
#01 <3D Scanned Tree Forks- 01-05> 
#02 <3D Scanned Tree Forks- 06-10>
.
file size is so damn big that my gaming laptop barely move, I got to find a way to simplfy the work to make it easier for my life.
So here I find a way to exact the middle point of each branches and play around with it. Here is the link of the tutorial of how the branches intoi tree skeleton, made it lighter, so as my life.
